This is a cheerio test project (practise)

This test project is made by following the video : http://vimeo.com/31950192

Basic code is downloaded from here : http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-scrape-web-pages-with-node-js-and-jquery--net-22478

However, they only supplied the source code without package.json file.

This is project was created 4 years ago (2011), they used very old api. So I found the old version of packages and persisted them into the package.json.


To run this project, you should run:

```npm install

then

```node app.js
